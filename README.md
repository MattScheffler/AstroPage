# AstroPage
Hosted here: http://astropage.neocities.org/

A few html pages and a css for general astrophysics information and links.

Meant more for a general audience that is interested in astrophysics but is unfamiliar with the field.

Some information for people more informed with the subject is also made available.

I am not affiliated with any of the sites I link, I just add places I think are useful.
