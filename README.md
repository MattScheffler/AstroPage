# AstroPage
Hosted here: [ astropage.neocities.org ](http://astropage.neocities.org/)

A website for general astrophysics information and resources.

Meant more for a general audience that is interested in astrophysics but is unfamiliar with the field.

The main feature (for the moment) will be the self-teaching guide.

Some information for people more informed with the subject is also made available.

I am not affiliated with any of the sites I link, I just add places I think are useful.
