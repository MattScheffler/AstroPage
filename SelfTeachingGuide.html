<section class="introSection">
<p class="introText">This section is meant to be an overview of subjects learned in a typical astrophysics degree program at the undergraduate level. Online resources and/or book recommendations will 
be made, use what you feel works best for you. <i>How</i> you obtain any books you may want to read is up to you. The exact materials, and depth of study for each area, will vary depending on the 
school attended. In general there are things every astrophysics student would be expected to have had some contact with though, and I will try to cover all of those. The areas of study will be
broken up into four sections: <a href="#math">Mathematics</a>, <a href="#phys">Physics</a>, <a href="#astro">Astronomy</a>, and <a href="#misc">Miscellaneous</a>. I would suggest having a firm
understanding of mathematics up to at least basic calculus before attempting to go too far into the physics and astronomy work. These subjects rely heavily on mathematics, and a lack of understanding of
their mathematical foundation will only make things harder for yourself. The miscellaneous section is for things that don't necessarily fall into the other three categories, but would be useful too
know anyway. It's <i>mostly optional</i> but definitely worth going through if you can.</p>
<p class="introText">If this seems like a lot of work, that's because it is. There is no easy way to get a good understanding of this enormous field. It requires dedication and a lot of time. I suggest 
that if whatever resources you are using have practice problems, attempt as many as you can without looking up solutions first. Even if you get stuck, or get the wrong answer, the problem solving skills 
you develop from them over time will be invaluable. The ability to handle complex problems will not only aid you in your studies, by will also likely help you in your everyday life. Getting discouraged is
natural, for every mountain you climb there will be an even larger one waiting ahead of you. I personally think gaining some true understanding of how our universe works, even if only a small amount,
is worth it.</p>
