<section class="introSection">
<p class="introText">This section is meant to be an overview of subjects learned in a typical astrophysics degree program at the undergraduate level. Online resources and/or book recommendations will 
be made, use what you feel works best for you. <i>How</i> you obtain any books you may want to read is up to you. The exact materials, and depth of study for each area, will vary depending on the 
school attended. In general there are things every astrophysics student would be expected to have had some contact with though, and I will try to cover all of those. The areas of study will be
broken up into four sections: <a href="#math">Mathematics</a>, <a href="#phys">Physics</a>, <a href="#astro">Astronomy</a>, and <a href="#misc">Miscellaneous</a>. I would suggest having a firm
understanding of mathematics up to at least basic calculus before attempting to go too far into the physics and astronomy work. These subjects rely heavily on mathematics, and a lack of understanding of
their mathematical foundation will only make things harder for yourself. The miscellaneous section is for things that don't necessarily fall into the other three categories, but would be useful too
know anyway. It's <i>mostly optional</i> but definitely worth going through if you can.</p>
<p class="introText">If this seems like a lot of work, that's because it is. There is no easy way to get a good understanding of this enormous field. It requires dedication and a lot of time. I suggest 
that if whatever resources you are using have practice problems, attempt as many as you can without looking up solutions first. Even if you get stuck, or get the wrong answer, the problem solving skills 
you develop from them over time will be invaluable. The ability to handle complex problems will not only aid you in your studies, by will also likely help you in your everyday life. Getting discouraged is
natural, for every mountain you climb there will be an even larger one waiting ahead of you. I personally think gaining some true understanding of how our universe works, even if only a small amount,
is worth it.</p>

<p class="introText">There are a few resources that are useful for any of the sections below, those are <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/" target="_blank">Khan Academy</a> and 
<a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm" target="_blank">MIT OpenCourseWare</a>. Both of these are completely free and have a wealth of information covering many of the topics mentioned here. Khan Academy's
strengths are in the video lectures it offers, while the MIT site's strengths are in the problem sets and lecture notes from real professors. Additionally, 
<a href="http://www.openculture.com/" target="_blank">Open Culture</a> offers an aggregate of online courses and textbooks from all over the web. This makes it much easier to browse for content that fits 
your needs. Another general use resource I would highly recommend is <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/" target="_blank">Wolfram Alpha</a>. That site not only has informational pages, but has tools for
handling computations and graphing. Not all features are free, but what it offered for free is very useful.</p>

<p class="introText">Each section is numbered (roughly) in the order they should be studied. As for how the entire guide should be followed, I would <i>suggest</i> something like this:
Get comfortable with maths up to and including single-variable calculus. After that you can start on the physics, up to quantum mechanics. You will need to learn multi-variable calculus at some point
in there, so take care of that when you start seeing it. After special relativity you would be well prepared to start the astronomy sections. Some of the more advanced stellar astrophysics material will
require quantum mechanics and thermodynamics, so it would be good to jump over to physics and learn those areas if you haven't already at that point. Before quantum an thermodynamics you will want to learn 
linear algebra, statistics/probablility, and differential equations. Finish astronomy up to the general relativity section and that will cover most of what you need. Particle physics is great to know at 
least at a basic level, but isn't exactly essential for any of the other material. The same goes for chemistry. If you really want to test yourself after covering everything, 
<a href="#gre">the Physics GRE</a> will tell you just how much you know, or don't know!</p>

<h1>Astronomy</h1>
<h2>1. Basics</h2>
<p class="introText">The "basics" covers things like astronomical coordinate systems, celestial mechanics, color and magnitude scales, blackbody radiation, spectral lines, and telescope designs. 
Essentially everything that is covered in the first six chapters of <i class="teachingBook">An Introduction to Modern Astrophysics</i> by Carroll and Ostlie. That book is fantastic, and if you are very serious about 
learning astrophysics I would recommend getting a physical copy. It's main flaw is a lack of any solutions for the problems it has, unless you want to spend extra for the solutions manual.</p>

<h2>5. Instrumentation and Observational Techniques</h2>
<p class="introText"></p>

<h2>6. <a class="teachingLink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity" target="_blank">General Relativity</a></h2>
<p class="introText">This is an advanced topic and it is unlikely you would be expected to have more than a very basic idea of this subject at the level this guide is meant for. I only mention it because it 
is very important for several areas of astrophysics. If you have covered everything else and want a heavy challenge, this would be something to consider looking up.</p>
</section>

<section class="introSection" id="misc">
<h1>Miscellaneous</h1>
<h2>1. Chemistry</h2>
<p class="introText"></p>
<h2>2. <a class="teachingLink" href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Computer_Programming" target="_blank">Computer Programming</a></h2>
<p class="introText">If you were going to do any physics based research at a university, it is almost guaranteed you would need to know computer programming at some level. Even for independent learning, it
would be a good idea to get some experience with it for doing calculations and making graphs. There are <i>a lot</i> of programming languages out there, but the first one you learn isn't that important.
Once you know one, learning another isn't too difficult. Python is widely used in astronomy and fairly easy to work with so I would highly recommend that. Once you get some familiarity with it you can 
check the main page for links to additional python resources. If you were wanting something more challenging but also more powerful, C++ is a good choice. I'll provide a few nice tutorials for different 
languages here.</p>
<ul>
 <li><a href="http://www.learncpp.com/" target="_blank">LearnCpp</a> (C++)</li>
 <li><a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Non-Programmer%27s_Tutorial_for_Python_3" target="_blank">Non-programmer's guide for Python 3</a></li>
 <li><a href="http://www.fortrantutorial.com/" target="_blank">fortran tutorial</a></li>
</ul>
<p class="introText">Alternatively, there are software packages that you can get (at a price) for doing a lot of the work for you. These are 
<a href="http://www.wolfram.com/?source=nav" target="_blank">Mathematica</a> and <a href="http://www.maplesoft.com/products/Maple/"target="_blank">Maple</a>.
Both are very powerful and useful, although due to their proprietary nature they have some limitation that writing your own programs do not. There is also
<a href="http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/index.html?s_tid=gn_loc_drop" target="_blank">Matlab</a>, which is widely used in mathematics and physical sciences.</p>
